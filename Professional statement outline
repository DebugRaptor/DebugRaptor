One of my strengths is that I work well under pressure. I’m committed to developing more time management for projects or personal things and to learning Python. 

I think these strengths would help me a lot in my journey as a cybersecurity analyst.

I always loved the idea of protecting organizations or people, first as a police officer or as a soldier, but never had the opportunity to do it. Then I discovered cybersecurity and decided to follow the path.

What most interests me about the field of cybersecurity? - How do people trick employers into revealing passwords or sensitive information, I would love to understand how the treat actor mind works to prevent these situations.
Who is the audience for my professional statement? - Principally would be cybersecurity recruiters.
In what ways can my strengths, values, and interest in cybersecurity support the security goals of various organizations? - I think working under pressure is going to help the organizations in which I’m going to end up working.
